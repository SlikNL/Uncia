Uncia is a set of tools making writing scripts in PHP a much lesser pain
that is usually tends to.

It is in early stage, as well as hardly documented.
Please refer to demo.php for an overview of its capabilities.

USAGE:

	For normal use:
	require_once 'uncia/uncia.php';

	Default package gives you global aliases and error handling.
	If you do not want that:
	require_once 'uncia/bare.php';
	You can turn on global aliases or error handling selectively with
	\Slik\Uncia\aliases() and \Slik\Uncia\errors() accordingly.
